# Evan Gallagher â€“ Developer Portfolio

Hey, Iâ€™m Evan â€” a software developer with a background in marketing and product strategy, currently finishing up a Masterâ€™s Degree in Software Development. I like building tools that are both functional and user-friendly, especially when thereâ€™s some creativity involved. Below are a few projects Iâ€™ve built.

## GoodStuff â€“ iOS Music Player  
GitHub Repo:(https://github.com/Ecgal/GoodStuff-MusicPlayer)

A simple music player app I built in Swift for my father. Itâ€™s designed to be clean, minimal, and easy to use â€” focused on offline playback and a straightforward UI, dessigned with older users in mind.

**Tech:** Swift, UIKit  
**Highlights:**
- Local audio playback
- Custom UI designed for accessibility
- No fluff â€” just works

## MSD Script â€“ C++ / Qt 
GitHub Repo:(https://github.com/Ecgal/MSDScript)

Built a small interpreter for a functional language, with a GUI using Qt. Includes a parser, expression tree evaluator, and a polished editor. This one was all about getting deep into C++ and making something actually usable.

**Tech:** C++, Qt  
**Highlights:**
- Expression parsing and evaluation
- Live code editing in a desktop GUI
- Focus on readability and structure

## Modular Synthesizer â€“ Java / JavaFX  
GitHub Repo: (https://github.com/Ecgal/Synthesizer)

A desktop synth built in Java that lets you connect different audio components â€” sine waves, mixers, volume filters â€” and generate sound in real time. Built from scratch with Java and JavaFX.

**Tech:** Swift, UIKit 
**Highlights:**
- Drag-and-drop modular components
- Real-time audio output
- Signal flow logic and UI integration

## AI Podcast Generator (Still in development) 
Still finalizing the front end, but the core engine is up and running. This app generates podcast episodes using GPT-style script generation and TTS voices from Azure. Itâ€™s built to scale and monetize, with a lot of focus on making the voice sound natural.

**Tech:** React, Java, Azure TTS, Meta LLaMA  
**Whatâ€™s next:**
- Launching a demo page soon at [evanngallagher.com](https://www.evanngallagher.com)
- Tuning voices, adding audio previews, and building a clean landing page
