## Modular Synthesizer – Java / JavaFX  
GitHub Repo: (https://github.com/Ecgal/Synthesizer)

A desktop synth built in Java that lets you connect different audio components — sine waves, mixers, volume filters — and generate sound in real time. Built from scratch with Java and JavaFX.

**Tech:** Java, JavaFX
**Highlights:**
- Drag-and-drop modular components
- Real-time audio output
- Signal flow logic and UI integration
